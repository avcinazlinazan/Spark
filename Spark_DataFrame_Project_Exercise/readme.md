Analysis Includes:

Examining the DataFrame's schema and initial rows.

Calculating and formatting key statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.

Finding the correlation between high price and trading volume.

Determining the maximum and average values on a yearly and monthly basis.
