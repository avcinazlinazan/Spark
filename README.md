Pyspark Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented using PySpark and the MLlib library. The goal is to demonstrate various machine learning techniques on large-scale datasets, leveraging PySpark's distributed computing capabilities.

Contents
This repository covers the following machine learning areas:

Regression: Predicting continuous numerical values. Projects in this section may include linear regression examples.

Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm for predicting categorical outcomes.

K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping similar data points.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques for processing and analyzing text data, such as tokenization, feature extraction, and sentiment analysis.

Recommender Systems: Algorithms for suggesting relevant items to users, potentially including collaborative filtering examples.

Getting Started
To run these projects, you'll need a PySpark environment. You can set this up locally or on a distributed cluster.

Prerequisites:

Apache Spark

Python 3.6+

PySpark library (pip install pyspark)

Usage:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/avcinazlinazan/Spark

Navigate to a specific project directory (e.g., cd regression_project).

Run the PySpark script: spark-submit your_script_name.py

Data
The datasets used in these projects will be specified within each project's directory. They may include publicly available datasets or synthetic data generated for demonstration purposes.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a PySpark MLlib project you'd like to share, please open a pull request.
