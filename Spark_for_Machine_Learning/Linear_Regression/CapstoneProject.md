## Crew Member Prediction Project with PySpark
Welcome! This is your first consulting project where you will apply your PySpark skills to a real-world business scenario. You have been tasked by the South Korean ship manufacturer, Hyundai Heavy Industries, to build a regression model.

### Project Task
Your objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the number of crew members required for a newly built ship. This will allow the client to accurately report the necessary crew size based on the ship's specifications when they sell it to a customer.

You have been provided with a dataset containing various ship features. Using this data, you will attempt to predict the Crew count.

### Project Dataset Features:

Ship Name: The name of the ship (string).

Cruise Line: The cruise line the ship belongs to (string).

Age: The age of the ship (numerical).

Tonnage: The tonnage of the ship (numerical).

Passengers: The passenger capacity (numerical).

Length: The length of the ship (numerical).

Cabins: The number of cabins on board (numerical).

Passenger Density: The passenger density (numerical).

Crew: The required number of crew members (numerical - your target variable).

The Main Challenge: Handling Text Data
Your client has noted that the "Cruise Line" is a significant factor in determining the crew size. However, this column is in a string format. Since machine learning models typically work with numerical data, you need to convert this text data into a numerical form.

Hint: For this project, you are expected to use the StringIndexer function from PySpark's pyspark.ml.feature library. This function converts unique string values into numerical indices. You should research how to use this tool from the documentation and incorporate it into your analysis of the Cruise Line column.

### Project Project Steps
Load and Explore the Data: Load the "Cruise Line Info.csv" file into PySpark. Inspect the dataset's schema and its contents.

### Project Feature Engineering:

Combine Numerical Columns: Use VectorAssembler to combine all numerical columns (Age, Tonnage, Passengers, etc.) into a single "features" vector.

Convert Text Data: Use StringIndexer to convert the "Cruise Line" column into a numerical format, and then include this new column in your VectorAssembler process.

Split the Data: Randomly divide your final DataFrame into a 70% training set and a 30% testing set.

Train the Model: Create a model using the LinearRegression class and train it on your training data.

Evaluate the Model: Assess the performance of your trained model on the test data using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared (R²).

Use the Model: Demonstrate how to use the trained model to predict the crew count on new (unlabeled) ship data.
## Strengths:
Clear and Structured Narrative: The project description, objective, dataset features, main challenges, and step-by-step project plan are clearly separated into sections. This makes it easy for the reader to understand the topic.

### Realistic Scenario: 
Linking the project to a company like Hyundai Heavy Industries makes it feel like more than just a theoretical exercise; it feels like solving a real-world business problem, which increases motivation.

### Emphasis on the Main Challenge: 
The hint about how to handle string data (Cruise Line) is very helpful. Highlighting StringIndexer clarifies what the focus of the project should be.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
 Each phase of the project (Data Loading, Feature Engineering, Data Splitting, Model Training, Evaluation, Usage) is listed in detail. This provides a clear roadmap for the user to follow.

### Areas for Improvement (Suggestions):
Example Outputs: Adding short examples of expected output for each step (e.g., a portion of the printSchema() output or predictions.show() output) could help users verify that they are on the right track.

### More Options: 
While StringIndexer is a good starting point, other text transformation methods like OneHotEncoder could also be briefly mentioned. This would broaden the user's perspective.

### Providing Context: 
Adding a brief explanation of what metrics like RMSE and R² mean, and what values would be considered "good" for this project, would make the evaluation step more meaningful.
