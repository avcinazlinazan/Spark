## Linear Regression Analysis on E-Commerce Customer Data with PySpark
This text explains a Jupyter Notebook solution that demonstrates how to build and evaluate a linear regression model using Apache Spark's machine learning library (MLlib) on an e-commerce customer dataset. The goal is to predict the annual amount a customer will spend.

### 1. Data Preparation and Exploration
The first step is to load the dataset into PySpark and understand its structure.

Data Reading: The "ECommerce_Customers.csv" file is read using the spark.read.csv() function.

inferSchema=True: Allows Spark to automatically determine the column data types.

header=True: Specifies that the first row of the CSV file should be used as the column headers.

Schema and Data Inspection: printSchema() is used to examine the dataset's structure. The columns include text data like Email, Address, and Avatar, as well as numerical data such as Avg Session Length and Time on App.

Sample Data Viewing: df.show() displays the first few rows of the data.

Indexing methods like row[0][4] are used to show the value in a specific row and column, revealing that the values in the Avatar column are simply colors.

### 2. Setting Up the DataFrame for Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms typically expect data in a single feature vector. Therefore, we need to combine the numerical columns into one single column.

Required Libraries:

pyspark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler: Used to combine multiple numerical columns into a single feature vector column.

pyspark.ml.linalg.Vectors: Used for working with vector objects.

Defining Feature Columns: The numerical columns to be used for prediction (Avg Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership) are defined in a list.

Creating a VectorAssembler:

assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=features_cols, outputCol='features'): A VectorAssembler object is created. The inputCols parameter specifies which columns to combine, and outputCol names the new column to be created.

Transforming the Data:

output = assembler.transform(df): The transform() method of the assembler object is used to combine the numerical columns from the original DataFrame into a new features column.

output.printSchema(): Confirms the presence of the new features column in the DataFrame.

output.select('features').show(): Inspects the content of the newly created feature vector.

### 3. Splitting the Dataset
To train and test the machine learning model, the data is split into a training set and a test set.

final_data = output.select('features', 'Yearly Amount Spent'): A new DataFrame is created containing only the feature vector (features) and the target variable (Yearly Amount Spent).

train_data, test_data = final_data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3]): The randomSplit() method is used to randomly partition the data into a 70% training set and a 30% test set. This is a common practice in machine learning.

### 4. Training the Linear Regression Model
Next, we create and train the linear regression model using the training data.

Model Creation:

from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression: The LinearRegression class is imported.

lr = LinearRegression(labelCol='Yearly Amount Spent'): A LinearRegression object is created. The labelCol parameter specifies the target variable to be predicted (Yearly Amount Spent).

Model Training:

lr_model = lr.fit(train_data): The model is trained on the training data using the fit() method. This process learns the relationship between the features and the target variable.

### 5. Evaluating the Model
To understand how well the trained model performs, it is evaluated on the test data.

test_results = lr_model.evaluate(test_data): The model is run on the test data using the evaluate() method. This compares the predicted values with the actual values.

Inspecting Metrics:

test_results.rootMeanSquaredError: Calculates the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This value indicates the average deviation of the model's predictions from the actual values.

test_results.r2: Calculates the R-squared (R²) value. This metric shows how much of the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model. A high R² value like 0.98 suggests the model fits the data very well.

### 6. Making Predictions with New (Unlabeled) Data
Finally, it is demonstrated how the trained model can be used in a real-world scenario.

Preparing Unlabeled Data: An "unlabeled" dataset (unlabeled_data) for which we want to make predictions is created by selecting only the features column from the test_data.

Making Predictions:

predictions = lr_model.transform(unlabeled_data): The transform() method is used to make predictions on the unlabeled data.

Viewing the Results: predictions.show() displays the prediction results. The output shows the prediction value for each feature vector, representing the model's estimated annual spend.

This notebook provides a fundamental overview of how to perform the necessary feature engineering for machine learning, train and evaluate a model, and make predictions on new data using PySpark.
